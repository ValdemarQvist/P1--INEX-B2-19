\chapter{Conclusion}\label{ch:conclusion}

%Hades needs to have a high enough velocity or torque to clear obstacles, but on the other hand if the velocity is to high the map gets distorted.The most detailed map was produced when the robot was moving at a constant velocity of 0.2. There is a need to find the most optimal velocity when Hades is develop, so Hades can drive over obstacles and still makes a detailed map. Hades will not have the problem of interference off people on Mars. Hades can also detect drops so it does not drive over an edge, that can destroy or flip over the Hades. Does Hades have the ability to carry a pay load we don't known yet?!?!?!?!?!?!?

Hades is a robot which can map an area, make a path and avoid obstacles on its own. The robot is autonomous and manual. Hades is going to be sent to Hellas Basin crater on Mars to explore the environment. To avoid obstacles Hades will use LIDAR and Radar sensors to perceive the surroundings. As moving parts it is going to be implemented with wheels. As an energy source, a RTG is chosen.\\ 
The hardware base for this project is a turtlebot equipped with an ASUS XtionPRO Live sensor. The provided background software is ROS running on Ubuntu Linux 16.04. In order to simulate the environment, a map is created for the turtleBot using SLAM.\\
The specific requirements for the turtlebot succeeded. The purpose to avoid obstacles and map an unknown area was achieved.
