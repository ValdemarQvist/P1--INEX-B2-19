\section{Detection} 
The Turtlebot uses The ASUS Xtion PRO LIVE as its vision. Xtion PRO LIVE has two microphones on each side, see figure \ref{fig:asusCamera}.\\ nr. 1.: The Xtion PRO LIVE has an RGB camera with a resolution of 640px x 480px at 30 fps, see figure \ref{fig:asusCamera}.\\ nr. 3: Is a IR camera that has a resolution of 640px x 480px at 30 fps or 320px x 240px at 60 fps,the Ir camera captures the IR projection see figure \ref{fig:asusCamera}.\\
nr. 2 and 4.
 has a vision distance range from 0.85 m up to 3.5 m and have a field of vision 58° Horizontal, 45° Vertical, 70° Diagonal.
This camera is best for indoor use \ref{ch:CameraRGB}.

\section{Path-planning}

\subsection{ROS}
ROS is a framework to interact with robots. This operation system comes with a collection of libraries and different tools to execute the communication.\\
The idea with ROS is to connect topics to each other through nodes. On each node there is a topic that you can subscribe or publish to. When there is published or subscribed on a topic it is received in a message that contain the data of this topic. The data can then be used in different programs, to interact with the robot or get information about location and visualization. \\
Before all of this can work there is the need for ROS-master. The ROS-master keeps track of every topic that has been subscribed or published to \cite{ROSwiki}.

\subsection{Rviz}
Rviz is a program used by ROS to provide 3D images and point clouds from data given by the robots sensors. Rviz lets the user spectate the robot in different ways. The input the robot gets from cameras and sensors is numbers and coordinates. Rviz converts these numbers into 3D objects which represent these objects \cite{interactiveMarkers}.

\subsection{Frontier\_exploration}
Frontier\_Exploration package will be used as a algorithm for Hades to navigate through a perceived environment.\\
The Package provides a costmap\_2D, client/server nodes and Layer BoundedExplorerLayer. The BoundedExplorerLayer can be used for many complex explorations, functioning by two services. Updatepolygonfrontier, this is where the input is telling the robot which area to scan. Then the service GetNextFrontier, will wait for user input and then run the first service again.\\
The robot in this project has no global map, which means the robot should be able to create the map on its own. This can be done autonomously by publishing a starting point, it will then determine its own path and act accordingly. Furthermore, it will still be able to allow user input, such as a published polygons \cite{ROSexploration}.\\
For creating a map in an uknown environment, this has been chosen.


\subsection{SLAM}
SLAM is not a specific algorithm, but a concept where there are many different approaches. That is why there is different solutions for SLAM. Some are made for indoor use, some for outdoor use.\\
SLAM uses a mapping package \textit{gmapping} in ROS. The gmapping package in ROS is called slam\_gmapping. This package uses data collected from lasers and the robots position to create a 2D map. %Furthermore, slam\_gmapping creates a 2D map in Rviz with lasers and position data collected by the robot.\\
When the robot starts mapping, the localization system AMCL helps the robot to move safely from one location to another.
Information from sensors, such as odometry and gyroscope, is collected when mapping. \\
By comparing data from sensors to the known map, it measures how far it has moved. Moreover, looks at the surrounding area to check its new relative position.\\The robot visualize a map to find the trajectory to move forward. The localization system, AMCL, working-process is described in figure \ref{fig:amcl}.
\begin{figure}

    \includegraphics[width=.7\textwidth]{figures/AMCL.png}
    \caption{AMCL working process\cite{AMCL}} 
    \label{fig:amcl} 
\end{figure}
 During operation, AMCL estimates the transformation of the base frame in respect to the global frame. But it only publishes the transformation between the global frame and the odometry frame\cite{AMCL}.

\section{Movement}
To move the turtlebot manually, the user can through the terminal give velocity commands to the robot. When using frontier exploration node, the user appoints an area to be searched in Rviz. The frontier node calculates a small path to be explored, this gets translated into velocity commands by the move\_base node. The velocity commands gets converted into a PWM signal to the motor driver for the turtlebot.

\subsection{Manual navigation}
Before it is possible to send any data to the turtlebot, a node has to be build. In this node a publisher has to be declared, to send a message on a topic. In this node topic is /move\_base\_simple/goal and the messages type it send is a geometry\_msgs::PoseStamped see \ref{fig:nodehandle}.
\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=.7\textwidth]{figures/initByC.png}
    \caption{Initializing nodehandel} 
    \label{fig:nodehandle} 
\end{figure}

The geometry\_msgs::PoseStamped contains different members, it has a header member and a pose member. Inside the Pose member there is more members position and orientation, in the member position a x, y and z coordinate can be stated for the turtlebot to move to, but there is no need to state the z coordinate because the turtlebot only works on a bi-dimension plane.\\ 
The heading is set by the z orientation member \ref{fis:msg}. One thing to remember is that orientation is always relative to the turtlebot, meaning that the x axis is directly front to back and the y axis is going through sides on the turtlebot. When the user has entered some coordinates the message get published with the information and the ??? is subscribing to the topic /move\_base\_simple/goal will then make a path on what information there is in the map already.
