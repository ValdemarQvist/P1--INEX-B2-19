\section{Materials}

Material used in space missions, must be light enough, and have the ability to withstand the harsh environment of the space.
 Our ability to manipulate different parts of the rover and repair them if needed during the mission is highly limited due to different reasons, such as the communication delay and the complexity of a comprehensive repair mechanism. This results in rely on the use of materials that are sometimes difficult to contain or attain. A good example to this would be the radioisotope of certain elements used in thermo-electric batteries which are extremely complicated to handle yet more reliable then solar panels\cite{NuclearPower}. 
 There is a different mentality for material used in space in a sense that, we are not using the same kind of material if we were to build a rover to explore caves or inaccessible areas on earth. To help understand this we could consider that, erosion could have different meanings on mars compare to earth.
