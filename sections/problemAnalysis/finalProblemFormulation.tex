\chapter{Final problem formulation}\label{ch:finalproblem}
\textit{How is it possible for Hades to explore Hellas Basin crater on Mars, preventing unnecessary damages by overcoming the chaotic terrain and being able to detect and avoid driving too close to water or ice caps, breaking the law?}


%How is it possible to design an autonomous vehicle that can move around in an unknown area. While the vehicle has to autonomously navigate and avoid obstacles.
%How can a robot be designed so that it can map, move in an unknown area and avoid obstacles? 
%How is it possible to design a rover that can move in an unknown area while map and avoid obstacles?
%How is it possible to design a rover that uses SLAM for moving in an unknown area while mapping and avoiding obstacles?
%It is possible to create a robot with existing solutions, who? can avoid obtacles and map the area by his own in unknown places?
%How is it possible to design a rover that uses SLAM for automatically moving in an unknown area while mapping and avoiding obstacles, but also possible to be controlled manually.
%Considering to Mars environment Chapter \ref{ch:environmentOnMars} and space law Chapter \ref{ch:Spacelaw} robot has to survive different climate and mach all the reguirements. Scan the area  and avoid obstacles while using RTG Chapter \ref{ch:solutionProposal}. But how robot can move automatically in unknown are while mapping and avoiding obstacles, but also possible to be controlled manually and be better that other existing solutions Chapter \ref{ch:existingSolutions}?
%\section{Design proposal}\label{ch:Designproposal}
%This section will give a short description of how the robot should function.\\
%The robot needs motors to accelerate, decelerate and overcoming the incline that is set at a maximum of 7\%. For vision the robot will use a LIDAR sensor for detecting and ranging the terrain.\\
%For the robot to move through the perceived environment, it will need a algorithm to assist moving autonomously.\\
