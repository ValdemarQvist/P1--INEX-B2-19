\chapter{Final problem formulation}\label{ch:finalproblem}
%How is it possible to design an autonomous vehicle that can move around in an unknown area. While the vehicle has to autonomously navigate and avoid obstacles.
%How can a robot be designed so that it can map, move in an unknown area and avoid obstacles? 
%How is it possible to design a rover that can move in an unknown area while map and avoid obstacles?
%How is it possible to design a rover that uses SLAM for moving in an unknown area while mapping and avoiding obstacles?
%It is possible to create a robot with existing solutions, who? can avoid obtacles and map the area by his own in unknown places?

How is it possible to design a rover that uses SLAM for automatically moving in an unknown area while mapping and avoiding obstacles, but also possible to be controlled manually.



%\section{Design proposal}\label{ch:Designproposal}
%This section will give a short description of how the robot should function.\\
%The robot needs motors to accelerate, decelerate and overcoming the incline that is set at a maximum of 7\%. For vision the robot will use a LIDAR sensor for detecting and ranging the terrain.\\
%For the robot to move through the perceived environment, it will need a algorithm to assist moving autonomously.\\
