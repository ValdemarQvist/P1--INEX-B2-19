In addition to these achievements NASA is going to investigate more money on Mars rovers, exploring a deeper environment of Mars. This Project specifies a lot of time and money to send another more complicated robot to Mars.
Furthermore, Europe space agency (ESA) spend more than 5.77 billion dollars on the resources on Mars. But all preparations were unsuccessful. Despite bad projects, ESA is going to try to explore their resources in the future\cite{EconomicESA2}\cite{EconomicESA}.
