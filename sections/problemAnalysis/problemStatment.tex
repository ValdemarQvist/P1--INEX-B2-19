\chapter{Initial problem statement}

The aim of this project is to design an autonomous robot, which can simulate an interplanetary rover on Mars. The robot has to drive in an unknown environment, while mapping the area and avoiding obstacles. The robot has to have two types of controlling mechanisms, one which is automatic and the other which is manual.\\
\\
This project will look into the following:

\begin{itemize}
\item How to control the robot.
\item How to map an area.
\item How to avoid obstacles.
\item How to get the robot to autonomously navigate in an unknown environment.
%\item How to maneuver in an unknown environment
%\item How to communicate with INEX (satellites, etc.)
\end{itemize}

This report will look into different components suited for mapping and avoiding obstacles.
Additionally, this report will contain an analysis of operational efficiency for the ideal design description, including the following components: Wheels, energy sources, sensors, and other features.

%To further the research on another planet we have been tasked to design an autonomous robot, which can scout and explore the surface of other planets.\todo{can we use "we" here?} How is it possible to explore new planets for humanity to inhabit. What will the requirements be for this interplanetary space-travel?\todo{Wait, do we want to know how to make the space-travel? Don't we just want to know how the robot can work on Mars?}

%\begin{itemize}
%\item How to map the area
%\item How do the robot avoid obstacles
%\item How to overcome the delay time (delay time of 14 min)
%\item How do we communicate with the robot (satellites, etc.)
%\item Control. (Left, Right, Forward and visual)
%\item How to maneuver in an unknown environment.
%\end{itemize}

%This report will look into the different components best suited for mapping and avoiding obstacles. Additionally, this report will contain an analysis of operational efficiency for the ideal design description including the following components: Wheels, fuel source, sensors, and other features.
