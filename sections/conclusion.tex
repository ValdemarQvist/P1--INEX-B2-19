\chapter{Conclusion}\label{ch:conclusion}

Hades needs to have a high enough velocity or torque to clear obstacles, but on the other hand if the velocity is to high the map gets distorted.The most detailed map was produced when the robot was moving at a constant velocity of 0.2. There is a need to find the most optimal velocity when Hades is develop, so Hades can drive over obstacles and still makes a detailed map. Hades will not have the problem of interference off people on Mars. Hades can also detect drops so it does not drive over an edge, that can destroy or flip over the Hades. Does Hades have the ability to carry a pay load we don't known yet?!?!?!?!?!?!?
