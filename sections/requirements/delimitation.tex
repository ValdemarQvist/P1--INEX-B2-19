\chapter{Delimitation} \label{ch:Delimitation}

The ideal robot needs to:

\begin{itemize}
    \item The robot has to operate in an unknown outdoor area.
    \item The robot has to stay clear of obstacles with a height equal to the height from the ground to the chassis. 
    \item The robot has to be able to climb smaller than his size rocks without getting stuck.
    \item If an obstacle is not avoidable, the robot has to call for human interaction.%or try to avoid obstacle by selfe?
    \item The robot may not move more than 5 meters pr 14 minutes due to time delay.
\end{itemize}

The reguirements have to be taken in consideration to make the robot work more specific.\\
Most of the reguirements HADES robot can not to solve. 
HADES have to operate in indoor area of the infrared lighting caused by the sun will interrupt the vision of the cameras in the ASUS Xtion PRO LIVE, see chapter \ref{ch:CameraRGB}.\\
The chassis of HADES is only 1.5 cm from ground.Additionally, HADES would not be able to clear obstacles with a height of more than 1.5 cm.\\
Communication with HADES is delimited to the reach of the router D-LINK GO-RT-N300.\\
See \ref{fig:wifitest1} for 1cm connection stability.\\
See \ref{fig:wifitest2} for 10m connection stability.\\




%These requirements will have to be delimited for our robot to work.\\
%HADES does not quite meet the standards.\\
