\chapter{Delimitation} \label{ch:Delimitation}
The requirements for Hades will be adapted to the turtlebot and tested. The chassis bottom of the turtlebot is only reaching 1.5 cm above ground. This means the turtlebot will not be able to clear obstacles with a height of more than 1.5 cm.\\
The turtlebot will have to operate in an indoor area, because of the infrared lighting caused by the sun which can interrupt the vision of the cameras in the ASUS Xtion PRO LIVE, see section \ref{ch:CameraRGB}.\\
Communication with the turtlebot is delimited to the reach of the router D-LINK GO-RT-N300.\\
The signal strength at 1 cm away from the router and at 10 meters can be seen in figure \ref{fig:wifitest12} in appendix A.
