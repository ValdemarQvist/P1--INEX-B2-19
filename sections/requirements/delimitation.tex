\chapter{Delimitation} \label{ch:Delimitation}
 %\item The robot has to operate in an unknown outdoor area.
  %  \item The robot has to stay clear of obstacles with a height equal to the height from the ground to the chassis. 
   % \item The robot has to be able to climb smaller than his size rocks without getting stuck.
    %\item If an obstacle is not avoidable, the robot has to call for human interaction.%or try to avoid obstacle by itself?
    %\item The robot may not move more than 5 meters, before asking operators for new area to search.
Most of the requirements for Hades, the turtlebot would not be able to solve. Turtlebot have to operate in an indoor area, because of the infrared lighting caused by the sun that will interrupt the vision of the cameras in the ASUS Xtion PRO LIVE, see chapter \ref{ch:CameraRGB}.\\
The chassis of turtlebot is only 1.5 cm from ground. Additionally, the turtlebot would not be able to clear obstacles with a height of more than 1.5 cm.\\
Communication with HADES is delimited to the reach of the router D-LINK GO-RT-N300.
See figure \ref{fig:wifitest1} for 1 cm connection stability.
See figure \ref{fig:wifitest2} for 10 m connection stability.




%These requirements will have to be delimited for our robot to work.\\
%HADES does not quite meet the standards.\\
