\chapter{Delimitation} \label{ch:Delimitation}

The ideal robot needs to:

\begin{itemize}
    \item The robot has to operate in an unknown outdoor area.
    \item The robot has to stay clear of obstacles with a height equal to the height from the ground to the chassis. 
    \item The robot has to be able to climb a grading of 7\% without getting stuck.
    \item If an obstacle is not avoidable, the robot has to call for human interaction.
    \item The robot may not move more than 5 meters pr 14 minutes due to time delay.
\end{itemize}

These requirements will have to be delimited for our robot to work.\\
HADES does not quite meet the standards.\\
HADES will need to operate indoor because of the infrared lighting caused by the sun will interrupt the vision of the cameras in the ASUS Xtion PRO LIVE, see chapter \ref{ch:CameraRGB}.\\
The chassis of HADES is only 1.5 cm from ground to chassis so it wont be able to clear obstacles with a height of more than 1.5 cm.\\
Communication with HADES is delimited to the reach of the router D-LINK GO-RT-N300.\\

See \ref{tab:2} for 10m connection stability.\\
