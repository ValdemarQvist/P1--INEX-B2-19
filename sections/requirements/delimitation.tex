\chapter{Delimitation} \label{ch:Delimitation}
The requirements for Hades will be adapted to the turtlebot and tested. The chassis of turtlebot is only 1.5 cm from ground. This means the turtlebot will not be able to clear obstacles with a height of more than 1.5 cm.\\
The turtlebot will have to operate in an indoor area, because of the infrared lighting caused by the sun that will interrupt the vision of the cameras in the ASUS Xtion PRO LIVE, see section \ref{ch:CameraRGB}.\\
Communication with the turtlebot is delimited to the reach of the router D-LINK GO-RT-N300. The connection for 1 cm stability and 10 m stability can be seen in figure \ref{fig:wifitest12}.
