\section{Hardware}
For a robot to function as needed, it needs certain components, such as a motor, wheels systems and more. This section will describe the components that has been chosen to be the best solution for HADES.


\subsection{Wheels}
For the HADES project, wheels will be used as the means of to deliver traction for the robot, due to the maneuverability, endurance and low weight, See \ref{ch:Wheels}.\\
The wheels will be made of a hollow mesh that is formed in a wheel Sharp couture, so the wheels is not prone to puncture. Furthermore the wheels needs a design that makes the robot able to move in sand and be able to drive over rocks.  

\subsection{Odometry}
There is a visual odometry and a wheel based odometry, the aim in this project is to combine the feed from both the visual and wheel based odometry to generate a better localization of the robot in the map.
%\newline Wheel based odometers function by having 

\subsection{RTG}
RTG offers a dual solution of generating electricity for the rover, but also as a heating component to protect the robots sensory equipment from freezing up.
